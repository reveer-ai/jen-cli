# The agent substrate

A ground-up redesign of how work gets coordinated, built while its shape is still being
found. It is not an extension of `cli/`, and the two do not import each other.

## Nothing automated runs any of this

`agent/` is deliberately outside the repository's build, typecheck, test command, CI
workflow, and published tarball. Wiring an unfinished experiment into the checks that gate
every pull request would make it a condition of merging unrelated work.

The cost is real and it is yours to pay: **no automated check covers this directory**, so
nothing catches a regression here until a person runs the tests by hand. That is a reason
to test more carefully than you would under CI, not less.

```bash
npx tsc -p agent/tsconfig.json
npx vitest run --config agent/vitest.config.ts
```

**Run both before merging anything that touches `agent/`.** A green pull request says
nothing whatsoever about this directory.

The configs are the substrate's own and do not extend the repository's, on purpose — the
root `tsconfig.json` sets `rootDir: "cli"` and `outDir: "dist"`, and `dist/` is what the
published tarball is built from.

## The sandbox tests need a running container runtime

`sandbox/docker.test.ts` drives a real one. Nothing in it is mocked, because a driver whose
only job is to drive another program proves nothing against a stub of that program.

- Start the runtime first. On Docker Desktop, `docker desktop start`, then check with
  `docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'`. The suite fails in `beforeAll` with a
  message naming this rather than leaving you to read a creation error.
- The first run pulls `busybox:stable` and `hello-world:latest`. Slow once, cached after.
- Everything it creates is labelled `jen.run=<a per-run id>` and swept in `afterAll`. If a
  run is killed mid-way, `docker ps -a --filter label=jen.run` and
  `docker volume ls --filter label=jen.run` find what it left.

## What the environment passthrough actually does

The credential requirement — no secret on a command line, none on disk — rests entirely on
one documented but easily-missed behaviour, and it is verified:

**`docker run --env NAME` with no `=value` forwards the value from the `docker` process's
own environment.** Both short and long spellings work. The secret is then in the child's
environment and in the sandbox, and in no argv and no file.

Both obvious alternatives violate the requirement, so neither is a fallback:

- `--env NAME=value` puts the secret in `docker`'s argv, which every process on the machine
  can read for the life of the call.
- `--env-file` puts it on disk, which is what delivering secrets as environment exists to
  avoid — it reintroduces a cleanup step that can be interrupted.

`docker.ts` therefore imports nothing from `node:fs` and writes no file at all. A test
guards that at the source level, because a write added later is invisible to any
behavioural test that did not happen to look for the file it wrote.

## Asking whether a workspace exists: `volume ls`, never `volume inspect`

`docker volume inspect` exits non-zero both when the workspace is absent and when the
runtime cannot be reached, and the two are not separable from the exit code.

That matters more than it looks. Creation returns whether *this call* created the
workspace, and that answer is what licenses the unwind to delete it on a failure. Read an
unreachable runtime as "absent", and a transient error during a **resume** ends up
reporting a workspace this call created — handing the unwind permission to destroy a day of
the agent's work.

`docker volume ls --filter name=^NAME$ --format '{{.Name}}'` exits zero whether or not it
matched, so a non-zero exit means only that something really failed. Prefer that shape for
any other existence question here. The same lesson, learned the same way, is recorded for
`git fetch` in [`cli/AGENTS.md`](../cli/AGENTS.md).

## What a sandbox image has to provide

`sh` and `sleep`, and nothing else. Creation starts a shell loop as a trivial idle
entrypoint and `exec` is what starts real processes; a long single `sleep` is avoided
because the maximum argument `sleep` accepts varies between implementations.

An image with no shell is created and then fails to start. That is the behaviour
`hello-world:latest` is used for in the tests, and it is the **only** case that leaves a
remnant for the unwind to remove — a creation that fails on a missing image leaves nothing
behind at all. If you rewrite the unwind, note that the missing-image test passes with the
unwind deleted entirely; the `hello-world` one is what actually holds it.

## Adding a driver is a change, not an extension

The driver set is closed in source. No registry, no dynamic loading, no configuration
naming an implementation to load.

Exactly one driver exists, so nothing independently exercises the interface in
`sandbox/index.ts` and nothing can reveal an assumption that leaked through it. Its
independence is held by reading it — `sandbox/index.test.ts` makes that reading a test,
over the prose as well as the declarations. Keep it small enough to re-read in full, and
re-read it in full when a second driver is written.
